          I first found my passion for coding in early 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then I have learned to be proficient in frameworks 
          and languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, expressjs, and Nestjs. 
          My current favorite tech stack is: Angular for frontend, Nestjs for backend, and MySql as a database. Beside coding, I enjoy flight simulation 
          on networks such as <a href="https://vatsim.net" class="underline" target="_blank">VATSIM</a>. On VATSIM I hold a C1 rating and serve as volunteer division staff in the <a href="https://vatpac.org" class="underline" target="_blank">VATPAC</a> division. In VATPAC, I am part of
           their IT team and Air Traffic Services team where I make sectorfiles for the divisionally recognisec controller client, <a href="https://virtualairtrafficsystem.com/" class="underline" target="_blank">vatSys</a>.

          Coding aside, I love playing volleyball and being around friends and family. I love anything aviation related and dream to one day 
          be a commercial pilot. While I hate beaches, I love being underwater in the ocean. I hold a <a href="https://www.padi.com/" class="underline" target="_blank">PADI</a> certification that I obtained in summer
          2022. I love the tropics and have spent most of my live there. I am a son of God and love to worship Him through song. I have played acoustic guitar 
          for 8 years and am starting to learn electric guitar. Previousely I have played percussion in a band but due to the COVID-19 pandemic this 
          has faded.

          I have lived all over the world, from Europe to Asia, I call it my home. When I was four years old my family moved to England to learn the 
          language and my parents attended Bible school. After living in England for a year, we moved to the Philippines where we served as missionaries 
          for almost 11 years. Currently I reside in the Netherlands. Ontop of playing music, I also mix it. I am an amateur sound engineer and 
          make sure theres sound every Tuesday morning during the weekly worship service.
